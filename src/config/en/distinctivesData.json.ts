        question: "Sufficient View of Scripture",
        answer: "The Bible is the very Word of God (2 Tim. 3:16) and is therefore without error and completely trustworthy in all that it asserts.<ul><li><b>Inspiration</b> — Verbal and complete inspiration (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21). Scripture is “breathed out” by God. God inspired the writers of the Biblical texts through His Holy Spirit to write the message He desired while using their unique styles and language.</li><li><b>Inerrancy</b> — It contains no errors. God conveyed truth to divinely chosen individuals. What they wrote did not stray from the original formulation of truth as it existed in the mind of God (Psalm 19).</li><li><b>Infallibility</b> — The Word of God is incapable of erring. When the Lord inspired the authors of Scripture, He worked so as to make it impossible for them to affirm error in the completed product. In other words, it is never wrong and thus completely trustworthy (Psalm 19:7; Titus 1:2).</li><li><b>Authority</b> — What it says I must do (Psalm 119). The ramifications of the authority of Scripture upon a ministry are manifold. For example, the church is never to stray outside the boundaries given in the Word of God. Every aspect of ministry (whether a sermon, Bible study, program, or activity) must be motivated by an understanding of the authority of Scripture and must bring Scripture to bear upon the lives of believers. Furthermore, since the Bible is completely authoritative for belief and practice, the church need not derive its methods from the culture nor conform its message to what is acceptable in the eyes of the world. Rather, ministry must be dictated by principles taught in Scripture itself.</li><li><b>Sufficiency</b> — 2 Peter 1:3-4; Psalm 19; 2 Tim. 3:17; Heb. 4:12 The Scriptures are not only authoritative over every aspect of life and ministry; they are also sufficient for the same. 2 Timothy 3:16-17 states, “All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” The implications of this verse are astounding, for it asserts that the Word of God is sufficient for all areas of ministry, including preaching, teaching, and counseling believers unto godliness. Therefore, the primary focus of every sermon, Bible study, or counseling opportunity must be the teaching of Scripture. <ul><li><u>Positively</u>: A ministry that believes in the sufficiency of Scripture will do everything possible to bring the Word to bear on the lives of the congregation. The sufficiency of Scripture demands that individuals as well as ministries be devoted to and trusting of the Word of God. In other words, a proper view of Scripture demands our obedience and our belief. It demands our affections, our faith, and our understanding.</li><li><u>Negatively</u>: A belief in the sufficiency of Scripture prohibits any attempt to integrate it with psychology or worldly philosophies that stand opposed to a biblical worldview.</li></ul></li><li><b>Relevance</b> — It is totally relevant for every situation (Psalm 19; 119:105; Isa. 40:8 2 Tim. 3:17). It may not give us an explicit answer to every specific problem, but it will always give us the principles by which we can, through obedience, glorify God.</li></ul>",

        question: "Proper View of Man",
        answer: "<ol><li><b>Mankind is <u>totally depraved</u>.</b><br /><br /> Total depravity does not mean that man always acts as wickedly as possible, but rather that wickedness so permeates his entire being that he is enslaved to it and is therefore unable to respond to the gospel in faith and repentance apart from the grace of God. Notice how the Scriptures portray mankind:<ul><li><i>On his own he cannot do good (Rom. 3:10-18).</i></li><li><i>On his own he is unable to understand or accept the things of God (1 Cor. 1:18; 2:14).</i></li><li><i>His heart is deceitfully wicked (Jer. 17:9-10).</i></li><li><i>His goal in life is selfish and only evil continually (Gen. 6:5; Eccl. 9:3).</i></li></ul></li><li><b>Mankind <u>continually sins</u>.</b><br /><br />Sin is any disobedience or rebellion against God. It is manifested in refusing to think, feel, act, and speak according to what He commands (omission), and/or in insisting on thinking, feeling, acting, and speaking in ways which He forbids (commission).<br /><br />Sin chiefly concerns the heart. To be sinfully angry with your brother is enough to convict you of murder (Matthew 5:22), and to lust after another person is to commit adultery with that person in your heart (Matthew 5:28). Therefore, though one may be externally above reproach, internally we are guilty of breaking the entire law (James 2:10).</li></ol>",

        question: "Accurate View of The Church",
        answer: "In Matthew 16:18, Christ said, “I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not overpower it,” and He has done just that!<ol><li><b>The Composition of the Church</b> <br /><br / > The church is made up of all the men and women who have repented of their sin and placed their faith in Christ.The church is a living organism made up of true believers who “offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 2: 5).<ul><li>Every believer has direct access to God through Jesus Christ and the church is a fellowship of priests serving together under the lordship of Christ.Now that Christ has fulfilled the representational role of the priesthood, and since He is the one mediator between God and men(1 Tim. 2: 5), there is no continuing need or role for a human priest.No longer does a human priest stand to represent other humans before God.As the people of God, the church is now a “royal priesthood” (1 Pet. 2: 9), ministering together in the name of Christ.</li><li><b>The problem </b>, there are religions that teach that we must have a mediator between us and God. The priesthood of believers replaces any notion of representational or sacramental ministrations.</li></ul></li><li><b>Christ's Role in the Church</b><br /><br />Christ so loved the church that He died for her (Eph. 5:25) that He might sanctify her and present her to Himself in all her glory, blameless and without spot or blemish (Eph. 5:26-27). Christ both nourishes and cherishes the church (Eph. 5:29), and He exists as head over His bride (Eph. 5:23).</li><li><b>The Function of the Church</b><br /><br />The church, having been “built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets” (Eph. 2:20), is to function as “the pillar and support of the truth” (1 Tim. 3:15). It is through the church that believers are equipped to mature into the likeness of Christ (Eph. 4:11-16) and unbelievers are presented the good news of the gospel (Matt. 28:19-20).</li><li><b>The Responsibilities of the Church</b><br /><br />The universal church finds concrete expression in the local church (a.k.a. the local assembly of believers). Because the church (local assembly) is God's primary vehicle for working in this age, it is vital that all believers identify with, function in, and submit to the leadership of a local church (Heb. 13:17). Believers are to edify one another with their spiritual gifts (Rom. 12:6-8; 1 Peter 4:10-11), regularly assembling together (Heb. 10:24-25) so that they might devote themselves to the teaching of God's Word, fellowship, celebration of the Lord's Supper, and prayer (Acts 2:42). Because of the premium that Scripture puts on this kind of involvement in the local church, any given ministry must seek to foster in God's people a deepening love for and commitment to the church, as well as a biblical understanding of what it means to function as the church.<ul><li>The church (local assembly) exists to worship and glorify God (1 Cor. 10:31; 1 Peter 2:4-12). </li><li>The church (local assembly) exists to be a repository of divine truth (1 Tim. 3:15). </li><li>The church (local assembly) exists to provide a context of loving fellowship for the purpose of mutual edification (Eph. 3:16-19; 4:12-16). </li><li>The church (local assembly) exists as a training center where people can grow through the application of teaching and the utilization of their spiritual gifts (1 Cor. 12-14; Rom. 12; Eph. 4:11-13). </li><li>The church (local assembly) exists to be a light in this dark world, for the evangelization of the lost (Matt. 5:13-16; 28:19-20; Titus 2:11-15; Acts 1:8). </li><li>The church exists to provide accountability for the purity of the church members (Matt. 18).</li></ul></li></ol>",

        question: "Strong View of Church Leadership",
        answer: "God has ordained how the leadership is to be structured. Though TCC is historically a congregational church, a better descriptor of our government would be “Elder Led, Congregational Rule.”<br /><br /><ul><li><b>The Office of Elder</b><br /><br />As numerous passages in the New Testament indicate, the words “elder” (presbuteros), “overseer” (episkopos), and “pastor” (poime-n) all refer to the same office. In other words, overseers and pastors are not distinct from elders; the terms are simply different ways of identifying the same people. The qualifications for an overseer (episkopos) in 1 Timothy 3:1-7, and those for an elder (presbuteros) in Titus 1:6-9 are unmistakably parallel. In fact, in Titus 1, Paul uses both terms to refer to the same man (presbuteros in v. 5 and episkopos in v. 7). All three terms are used interchangeably in Acts 20. In verse 17, Paul assembles all the elders (presbuteros) of the church of Ephesus to give them his farewell message. In verse 28 he says, “Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers [episkopos], to shepherd [poimaino-] the church of God.” First Peter 5:1-2 brings all three terms together as well. Peter writes, “Therefore, I exhort the elders [presbuteros] among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd [poimaino-] the flock of God among you, exercising oversight [episkopeo-] not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God.” The different terms, then, indicate various features of ministry, not varying levels of authority or separate offices, as some churches espouse.</li><li><b>The Plurality of Elders</b><br /><br />The consistent pattern throughout the New Testament is that each local body of believers is shepherded by a plurality of God-ordained elders. Simply stated, this is the only pattern for church leadership given in the New Testament. Nowhere in Scripture does one find a local assembly ruled by majority opinion or by a single pastor.<ul><li>The apostle Paul left Titus in Crete and instructed him to “appoint elders in every city” (Titus 1:5).</li><li>James instructed his readers to “call for the elders of the church” to pray for those who were sick (James 5:14).</li><li>When Paul and Barnabas were in Derbe, Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, they “appointed elders for them in every church” (Acts 14:23).</li><li>In Paul's first epistle to Timothy, the apostle referred to “the elders who rule well” at the church at Ephesus (1 Tim. 5:17; see also Acts 20:17, where Paul addresses “the elders of the church” at Ephesus).</li><li>The book of Acts indicates that there were “elders” at the church in Jerusalem (Acts 11:30; 15:2, 4; 21:18).</li><li>Again and again, reference is made to a plurality of elders in each of the various churches.</li></ul>Much can be said for the benefits of leadership made up of a plurality of godly men. Their combined counsel and wisdom helps assure that decisions are not self-willed or self-serving to a single individual (cf. Prov. 11:14).<br /><br />Because we see the value in this plurality, if there is division among TCC's elders in making decisions, all the elders will study, pray, and seek the will of God together until consensus is achieved. In this way, the unity and harmony that the Lord desires for the church will begin with those individuals he has appointed to shepherd His flock.</li><li><b>The Qualifications of Elders</b><br /><br />The character and effectiveness of any church is directly related to the quality of its leadership. That's why Scripture stresses the importance of qualified church leadership and delineates specific standards for evaluating those who would serve in that sacred position.<br /><br />The qualifications for elders are found in 1 Timothy 3:2-7 and Titus 1:6-8. According to these passages, an elder must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, gentle, not contentious, free from the love of money, not fond of sordid gain, a good manager of his household, one who has his children under control with dignity, not a new convert, one who has a good reputation outside the church, self-controlled, sensible, able to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict, above reproach as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, loving what is good, just, and devout.<br /><br />The single, overarching qualification, which the rest support, is that he is to be “above reproach.” That is, he must be a leader who cannot be accused of anything sinful because he has a sustained reputation for blamelessness. An elder is to be above reproach in his marital life, his social life, his business life, and his spiritual life. In this way, he is to be a model of godliness so he can legitimately call the congregation to follow his example (Phil. 3:17). All the other qualifications, except perhaps teaching and management skills, only amplify that idea.<br /><br />In addition, the office of elder is limited to men. 1 Timothy 2:11-12 says, “Let a woman quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness. But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.” In the church, women are to be under the authority of the elders, excluded from teaching men or holding positions of authority over them.</li><li><b>The Functions of Elders</b><br /><br />As the apostolic era came to a close, the written Word of God became the sole authority over the church. Elders were established to minister the Word of God to the church, and this office emerged as the highest level of local church leadership. Thus, it carried a great amount of responsibility.<br /><br />As managers and caretakers of the church (1 Tim 3:5, Acts 20:28), the primary responsibility of the elders is to care for the church by studying God's Word and applying it in the following areas:<ul><li>Determining church policy (Acts 15:22)</li><li>Ordaining others (1 Tim. 4:4)</li><li>Ruling, teaching, and preaching (1 Tim. 5:17; cf. 1 Thess. 5:12; 1 Tim. 3:2)</li><li>Exhorting and refuting (Titus 1:9)</li><li>Acting as shepherds, setting an example for all (1 Peter 5:1-3).</li><li><b>Congregational Affirmation</b><br /><br />As established above, elders are required to lead the church, and it is appropriate that they be empowered to make decisions relating to the life and ministry of the church. Furthermore, the congregation is called to submit to their leaders (Heb 13:17). However, elders are not infallible and do require involvement from the congregation in making decisions and holding them accountable.<br /><br />The New Testament shows the congregation actively involved in supporting and affirming the decisions of the church leadership. The following passages demonstrate this involvement:<ol><li>Acts 6 - Selection of elder-level leaders;</li><li>Acts 15:22 - Resolving major biblical/doctrinal issues;</li><li>I Corinthians 5 - Membership issues including discipline (This is reinforced in Matthew 18:17-18, and presumably would also apply to discipline of a leader [I Timothy 5:15-20; Romans 16:17-18]).</li></ol>As elders fulfill their role in leading the church, they also recognize the role and ministry of the Holy Spirit. The local body is said to be the “temple of the Holy Spirit” (1 Cor 3:16-17) which indicates that the Holy Spirit acts through the body corporately. With this in mind, the elders willingly and humbly submit all major decisions to the congregation for affirmation. If a decision is not affirmed by the congregation, the elders are committed to trust the congregation's opinion, withdraw their decision, and reevaluate and adjust accordingly.</li></ul></li></ul>",

        question: 'The Sufficiency of Scripture',
        answer:
            "We believe that God has provided us in the Scripture with everything necessary to nurture and sustain spiritual life. We believe that Scripture is central in the services of our church (1 Tim 4:13-16). Therefore, consecutive expository preaching is our normal and consistent approach to teaching the Scripture. We interpret Scripture using a literal, grammatical, historical hermeneutic. This means we are committed to teaching and to counseling directly and exclusively from the Word of God. Rather than seeking something more than God's glorious revelation, Christians need only to study and obey what they already have. We do not believe secular psychology has any legitimate role in the sanctification of believers. Scripture is sufficient.",

We believe that ecstatic outbursts and private prayer languages share nothing in common with the New Testament gift of tongues, and that they are patently unbiblical.

        question: 'Critical Race Theory & Social Justice',
        answer:
            "Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a modern approach to social justice change, developed from a broader critical theory, which is derived from political Marxism. It approaches issues like justice, racism, and inequality with specific intent of reforming or reshaping society. In practice, it does nothing other than inverting the oppressed and the oppressor groups. We believe that critical race theory entirely violates a biblical worldview by suggesting that people are defined by their ethnicity or class, rather than by their individual acts and attitudes. It incorrectly emphasizes intersectional categories such as gender, race, sexual preference, and economic status above and beyond a person's own choices and responsibilities (Galatians 3:28). Additionally, it conflicts with a biblical approach to absolute, objective truth by suggesting that an “oppressed” person's feelings matter more than what the “oppressor” has actually done or intended (1 Corinthians 4:4; 10:29). We believe when and where prejudices are found in the church, they should be addressed according to sound doctrine, not according to inherently secular and unbiblical approaches.<br /><br />For more on this, we refer you to <a href='https://statementonsocialjustice.com'>The Statement on Social Justice & the Gospel</a>.",
