        question: 'The Sufficiency of Scripture',
        answer:
            "We believe that God has provided us in the Scripture with everything necessary to nurture and sustain spiritual life. We believe that Scripture is central in the services of our church (1 Tim 4:13-16). Therefore, consecutive expository preaching is our normal and consistent approach to teaching the Scripture. We interpret Scripture using a literal, grammatical, historical hermeneutic. This means we are committed to teaching and to counseling directly and exclusively from the Word of God. Rather than seeking something more than God's glorious revelation, Christians need only to study and obey what they already have. We do not believe secular psychology has any legitimate role in the sanctification of believers. Scripture is sufficient.",

        question: 'The Office of Elder',
        answer:
            'We believe the New Testament indicates, the words “elder” (presbuteros), “overseer” (episkopos), and “pastor” (poimén) all refer to the same office. In other words, overseers and pastors are not distinct from elders; the terms are simply different ways of identifying the same people. The qualifications for an overseer (episkopos) in 1 Timothy 3:1-7, and those for an elder (presbuteros) in Titus 1:6-9 are unmistakably parallel. The consistent pattern throughout the New Testament is that each local body of believers is shepherded by a plurality of God-ordained elders.',

        question: 'A Changed Life',
        answer:
            "We believe that all those whom God has genuinely saved by grace through faith alone are new creatures in Christ and will demonstrate that new life by submission to Christ and obedience to God's Word. All Christians still sin, sometimes horribly, and sometimes for extended periods without repentance. But a decreasing pattern of sin and an increasing pattern of holiness will characterize every Christian's life. The saved will be dedicated to their Savior. A true Christian will not feel comfortable habitually living in unconfessed sin.",

        question: 'Gift of Tongues/Sign Gifts',
        answer:
            "We believe that the gift of tongues was the miraculous, God-given capacity to communicate the truth of God's Word in human languages the speaker had never learned or studied. It was a manifestation of God's power and blessing to validate the gospel message the apostles taught and to establish the early church. We believe that ecstatic outbursts and private prayer languages share nothing in common with the New Testament gift of tongues, and that they are patently unbiblical. Since there are no apostles today, there are no sign gifts to authenticate apostles. From the perspective of latter New Testament writers, the sign gifts had served their purpose and were all viewed in the past tense.",

        question: 'The Role of Women',
        answer:
            "We believe that both men and women bear the image of God and that those in Christ enjoy equal spiritual standing before God. But Scripture teaches that God has assigned different roles and responsibilities to men and women. In the home, the husband is to be the gracious, loving head and the wife is to submit to her husband's leadership. God has provided equally clear roles in the church. While there are many wonderful ways women can serve, We believe that Scripture forbids women from teaching and leading men, or in any way exercising authority over men in the context of the church.",

        question: 'Creation',
        answer:
            'We believe Genesis is a straightforward, literal presentation of the historical events it describes. We believe that God created everything in six literal days. We reject every form of theistic evolution.',

        question: 'Critical Race Theory & Social Justice',
        answer:
            "Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a modern approach to social justice change, developed from a broader critical theory, which is derived from political Marxism. It approaches issues like justice, racism, and inequality with specific intent of reforming or reshaping society. In practice, it does nothing other than inverting the oppressed and the oppressor groups. We believe that critical race theory entirely violates a biblical worldview by suggesting that people are defined by their ethnicity or class, rather than by their individual acts and attitudes. It incorrectly emphasizes intersectional categories such as gender, race, sexual preference, and economic status above and beyond a person's own choices and responsibilities (Galatians 3:28). Additionally, it conflicts with a biblical approach to absolute, objective truth by suggesting that an “oppressed” person's feelings matter more than what the “oppressor” has actually done or intended (1 Corinthians 4:4; 10:29). We believe when and where prejudices are found in the church, they should be addressed according to sound doctrine, not according to inherently secular and unbiblical approaches.<br /><br />For more on this, we refer you to <a href='https://statementonsocialjustice.com'>The Statement on Social Justice & the Gospel</a>.",
