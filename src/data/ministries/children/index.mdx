The Children's Ministry of Troutdale Community Church exists to glorify God through evangelizing children, encouraging parents, 
and edifying servants so that the gospel may be spread among our children, families may be supported, and the church may be strengthened.

## The following classes are offered:

* Nursery (0-2 years)
* Trackers (3-5 years)
* Explorers (6-10 years)

On the First Sunday of each month Explorers will stay in the main worship service.

## First Time Visiting?

Save time by completing our online Children's Ministry Registration form. This will allow you to check in quickly when you arrive.

## Does your child have special needs?

If so, we would love to include and accommodate them. Please complete the Children's Ministry Registration form so we can get a little more information to know 
your child's needs and understand how to best minister to you and your child.
