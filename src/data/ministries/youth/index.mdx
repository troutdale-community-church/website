## Rooted (6th -12th Grade)

Young people today are being sent mixed messages from our society. They are being confronted with both opportunities and temptations that were virtually unknown
a generation ago. At FBC, our young people are challenged to develop a God-centered view of the world and to courageously follow Jesus Christ in standing 
against the moral disintegration of our culture. 

TCC currently partners with Pleasant Home Community Church (sister church) for purposes of youth ministry. Along with PHCC, we seek to come alongside 
parents to help the students grow in the Lord. The youth ministry is not in competition with the family, but in allegiance to it, as the family is also 
in allegiance to Christ and his church

## Weekly Gathering

Wednesdays 6:30-8:00 pm

The youth ministry studies through books of the Bible and meets at Pleasant Home Community Church.
