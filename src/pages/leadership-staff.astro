Upon moving to Southern California, I completed my undergraduate degree in Biblical Counseling at The Master's University (2016) and my Master of Divinity at The Master's Seminary (2020). I am ACBC Certified, loves the Word of God, and seeks to teach its sufficiency and power to transform lives. I enjoy basketball, motocross, and playing fun games with my family."],
